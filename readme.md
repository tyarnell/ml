# XGBoost Estimator - Trainer Package Template

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template of how you can package an XGBoost training module to submit it to Cloud ML Engine. The template makes it easier to organise your code, and to adapt it to your dataset. In more details, the template covers the following functionality:
* Metadata to define your dataset
* Train, evaluate, and export the model.

Although the template provides standard implementation to different functionality, you can customise these parts with your own implementation.
